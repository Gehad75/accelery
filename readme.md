## Accelery

It's a project done for a capstone project to help small startups and entrepreneurs get support and know about all the accelerators that could help them.
The project is composed of four main pages: home, accelerators, resources, discussion. There is also an admin page to edit the data in the web app.

This program is written in **Laravel 5.7**, I have used the **Vogayer Admin Panel** and the **Chatter** dependency for the discussion forum.
